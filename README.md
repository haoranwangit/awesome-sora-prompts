[Sora](https://openai.com/sora) is an AI model that can create realistic and imaginative scenes from text instructions from OpenAI. OpenAI is teaching AI to understand and simulate the physical world in motion, with the goal of training models that help people solve problems that require real-world interaction.

Sora can provide following functions:
* text to video
* animating images
* extending generated videos
* video to video editing
* connecting videos
* image generation (text to image)

ðŸ“– In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with Sora. We have assigned different tags based on the style of the videos, allowing you to quickly find examples of prompts and the generated videos according to the tags, and modify them as needed.


While Sora is not yet officially released, we are gathering prompts comprehensively to help you quickly get started generating the videos you want with Sora. We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using Sora!

> A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick. She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights. Many pedestrians walk about.
